\textcenter{Introduction}

In the bustling lanes and serene landscapes of India, a home isn't just
a property; it's a dream, a legacy, and for many, a lifetime's
investment. But what determines the price of a house? Is it just about
the square footage? Or do other features, like the number of bathrooms,
the furnishing, or even the transaction type, come into play? As
potential homeowners navigate the complex real estate market, or
investors seek the next lucrative deal, understanding the dynamics of
house prices becomes paramount.

The Indian real estate market, teeming with diversity and vibrancy,
poses an exciting challenge for data enthusiasts. From the metropolitan
skyscrapers of Mumbai to the heritage homes of Jaipur, the factors
influencing house prices vary dramatically. Thus, predicting these
prices isn't merely a statistical challenge but a dance of understanding
cultural nuances, regional preferences, and emerging trends.

Enter the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process --- a
systematic and holistic approach to data analysis. By harnessing the
power of KDD, we can navigate the vast ocean of data to uncover
patterns, relationships, and insights that often remain hidden beneath
the surface. This article takes you on a journey through the KDD
process, employing rigorous data science techniques to decode the
intricacies of house prices in India.

Whether you're a budding data scientist, a real estate enthusiast, or
simply curious about the Indian housing market, join us as we delve
deep, ask questions, and let the data narrate its story.
\textcenter{Literature Review}

The prediction of real estate prices has been a topic of keen interest,
given its economic implications and the challenges it poses from a data
analysis standpoint. Various studies have employed different
methodologies, ranging from traditional statistical methods to advanced
machine learning algorithms. In the context of the Indian real estate
market, few studies have delved deep into understanding the myriad
factors influencing prices. The cultural, economic, and regional
diversity of India adds layers of complexity to this analysis. This
research builds upon existing literature, leveraging the systematic KDD
process to offer a comprehensive analysis.

\textcenter{Methodology}

The methodology adopted for this research revolves around the Knowledge
Discovery in Databases (KDD) process. It\textquotesingle s a systematic
approach encompassing various stages

\textcenter{Step 1: Data Selection}

In this initial step, we select the dataset relevant to the problem
we're trying to solve. In this case, you've provided the dataset, so
this step is essentially complete. However, it's crucial to understand
the data, its sources, and the features it contains.

Let's start by loading the dataset and taking a preliminary look at its
structure.

\includegraphics[width=5.16806in,height=1.51181in]{image1.png}

From the initial glimpse at the dataset, we can observe the following
columns:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Area: The area of the house (probably in square feet).
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  BHK: The number of bedrooms in the house.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Bathroom: The number of bathrooms.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Furnishing: The furnishing status (e.g., Semi-Furnished, Furnished).
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Locality: The location or address of the property.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Parking: Number of parking spaces.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Price: The price of the house.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Status: The status of the property (e.g., Ready to move).
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Transaction: Type of property transaction (e.g., New Property,
  Resale).
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Type: Type of the house (e.g., Apartment, Builder Floor).
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Per\_Sqft: Price per square foot.
  \end{quote}
\end{enumerate}

\textcenter{Step 2: Data Preprocessing}

Data preprocessing is a critical step in the KDD process. It involves
preparing the dataset for analysis by handling missing values, removing
outliers, and ensuring data quality. Let's break down the tasks:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Handling Missing Values: We'll identify and address any missing values
  in the dataset.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Data Cleaning: We'll look for any anomalies or inconsistencies in the
  data.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Data Type Conversion: Ensure that each feature has the appropriate
  data type.
  \end{quote}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{2.1 Handling Missing Values}

We have identified columns with missing values:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Bathroom: 2 missing values
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Furnishing: 5 missing values
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Parking: 33 missing values
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Type: 5 missing values
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Per\_Sqft: 241 missing values
  \end{quote}
\end{enumerate}

Let's address these missing values:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Bathroom: We can replace missing values with the median, considering
  that it's a discrete number.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Furnishing: We'll replace missing values with the mode (most frequent
  value) since it's a categorical feature.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Parking: We'll replace missing values with 0, assuming no parking
  space is available for these entries.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Type: We'll replace missing values with the mode.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Per\_Sqft: We can replace missing values with the overall median
  value, but a better approach might be to calculate it based on the
  `Area' and `Price' columns where possible.
  \end{quote}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{2.2 Data Cleaning}

Next, we'll check for anomalies and inconsistencies. For this dataset,
potential anomalies could include:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Houses with an area of 0.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Houses with a price of 0.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Any other inconsistent data in categorical columns.
  \end{quote}
\end{enumerate}

Great news! There are no anomalies related to houses with an area or
price of 0.

\textbf{2.3 Data Type Conversion}

Next, we'll ensure that each column has the appropriate data type. For
instance, columns like `Bathroom' and `Parking' should have integer data
types since they represent count values.

Data types have been successfully updated:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Bathroom: Converted from float64 to int64
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Parking: Converted from float64 to int64
  \end{quote}
\end{itemize}

\textcenter{Step 3: Data Transformation}

In this step, we'll prepare the data for modeling through various
transformations. This can include:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Feature Scaling: Standardizing or normalizing numerical features so
  they have similar scales.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Encoding Categorical Features: Converting categorical variables into a
  format that can be provided to machine learning algorithms to improve
  predictions.
  \end{quote}
\end{enumerate}

Before diving into transformations, let's conduct some Exploratory Data
Analysis (EDA) to understand our data better.

\textbf{3.1 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Distribution of Key Numerical Features: To understand the spread of
  data.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Correlation Matrix: To understand the relationships between numerical
  features.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Distribution of Categorical Features: To gauge the distribution of
  various categories.
  \end{quote}
\end{enumerate}

Let's start with the distribution of key numerical features such as
`Area', `Price', and `Per\_Sqft'.

The distributions provide the following insights:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Area: Most of the houses have an area ranging from 0 to 2000 sqft,
  with a peak observed around 500--1000 sqft.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Price: The majority of houses are priced below 2.5 crores, with a
  significant number of houses clustered in the lower price range.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Price per Sqft: Most values cluster in the lower range, indicating
  that the price per square foot is relatively consistent for many
  properties, with a few outliers.
  \end{quote}
\end{enumerate}

Next, let's visualize the correlation matrix to understand relationships
between the numerical features.

The correlation matrix provides insights into the relationships between
numerical features:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Area \& Price: There is a strong positive correlation between the area
  of the house and its price, which is expected as larger houses
  generally cost more.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  BHK \& Bathroom: The number of bedrooms (BHK) has a strong positive
  correlation with the number of bathrooms, indicating that as the
  number of bedrooms increases, the number of bathrooms typically also
  increases.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Area \& BHK: There's a moderate positive correlation, suggesting that
  as the number of bedrooms increases, the total area of the property
  generally also increases.
  \end{quote}
\end{enumerate}

Next, let's visualize the distribution of key categorical features like
`Furnishing', `Status', `Transaction', and `Type'.

The distributions of the categorical features provide the following
insights:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Furnishing: A significant number of houses are semi-furnished,
  followed by unfurnished and furnished.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Status: Most houses are ready to move in.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Transaction: The majority of the houses are up for resale, with fewer
  being new properties.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Type: The dataset contains more builder floor type houses than
  apartments.
  \end{quote}
\end{enumerate}

With a good understanding of our data from EDA, let's proceed to the
transformations.

\textbf{3.2 Feature Scaling}

We'll standardize the numerical features so they have a mean of 0 and a
standard deviation of 1. This is particularly useful for algorithms that
are sensitive to the scale of features.

\textbf{3.3 Encoding Categorical Features}

We'll convert categorical variables into numerical format using one-hot
encoding.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Numerical features like `Area', `BHK', `Bathroom', etc., have been
  standardized.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Categorical features have been one-hot encoded. For instance, the
  `Furnishing' column has been split into `Furnishing\_Semi-Furnished'
  and `Furnishing\_Unfurnished'. The first category in the original
  column (i.e., `Furnished') acts as a reference, so it's dropped to
  avoid multicollinearity.
  \end{quote}
\end{enumerate}

\textcenter{Step 4: Data Mining}

Data mining involves applying machine learning algorithms to the
preprocessed and transformed dataset to uncover patterns or to make
predictions. Given that our dataset is centered around predicting house
prices, this is a regression problem.

For this step, we'll:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Split the Data: Divide the data into training and testing sets.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Model Selection: Choose a suitable regression model.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Model Training: Train the model using the training data.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on the testing
  data.
  \end{quote}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Split the Data:}

The data has been split into training and testing sets:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Training Features (X\_train): 1007 samples, 10 features
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Testing Features (X\_test): 252 samples, 10 features
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Training Target (y\_train): 1007 samples
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Testing Target (y\_test): 252 samples
  \end{quote}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Model Selection and Training}

Given the regression nature of our problem, we'll start with a simple
linear regression model. Later, if needed, we can explore more complex
models. Let's train a linear regression model using the training data.

\begin{verbatim}
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
# Initialize the Linear Regression model
lr_model = LinearRegression()

# Train the model
lr_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on the test set
y_pred = lr_model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model's performance
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
rmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred, squared=False)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
\end{verbatim}

The linear regression model's performance metrics are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.4700.470
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.6860.686
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  R-squared (\emph{R²}) Value: 0.5930.593
  \end{quote}
\end{enumerate}

The R² value of approximately 0.593 indicates that the model explains
about 59.3\% of the variance in the house prices.

While this is a decent start, there's room for improvement. In practice,
one might explore other algorithms, hyperparameter tuning, or more
feature engineering to enhance performance. However, for the purpose of
this walkthrough, we'll proceed with this model.

Let's enhance the model performance through:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing
  ones.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the parameters of a regression model
  to improve its performance.
  \end{quote}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Feature Engineering}

For this dataset, a possible feature could be the ratio of bathrooms to
bedrooms. Typically, houses with a higher bathroom-to-bedroom ratio
might be considered more luxurious and could potentially have a
different price range.

The new feature `Bathroom\_to\_Bedroom\_Ratio' has been added to the
dataset.

\textbf{Hyperparameter Tuning}

For hyperparameter tuning, we'll use Ridge Regression --- a variant of
linear regression that includes L2 regularization. This can help prevent
overfitting, especially when we've added new features.

We'll utilize GridSearchCV to find the optimal alpha (regularization
strength) for Ridge Regression. Let's proceed with this.
\begin{verbatim}
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

# Define parameters for Ridge Regression
params = {
    'alpha': [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100]
}

# Initialize Ridge Regression
ridge = Ridge()

# Initialize GridSearchCV
grid_search = GridSearchCV(ridge, params, scoring='neg_mean_squared_error', cv=5, n_jobs=-1)

# Fit the model
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Best parameters from GridSearchCV
best_params = grid_search.best_params_
\end{verbatim}

The best hyperparameter for Ridge Regression, based on our search, is \alpha=100.

Now, let’s train the Ridge Regression model with this optimal hyperparameter and evaluate its performance on the test set

The performance metrics for the Ridge Regression model are:
\begin{verbatim}
    # Train Ridge Regression with the best parameter
best_ridge = Ridge(alpha=best_params['alpha'])
best_ridge.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on the test set
y_pred_ridge = best_ridge.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model's performance
mse_ridge = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred_ridge)
rmse_ridge = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred_ridge, squared=False)
r2_ridge = r2_score(y_test, y_pred_ridge)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.4740.474
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.6880.688
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  R-squared (R²) Value: 0.5900.590
  \end{quote}
\end{enumerate}

The Ridge Regression model's performance is quite similar to the initial
Linear Regression model. While the R² value is slightly lower, it's
important to note that Ridge Regression provides the advantage of
reducing overfitting, especially with the addition of new features.

\textcenter{Step 5: Pattern Evaluation}

Pattern evaluation involves interpreting the model's results, assessing
its significance, and determining its reliability. This is essential to
understand the strengths and weaknesses of the model and to derive
actionable insights.

In this step, we'll:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Feature Importance: Identify which features are most influential in
  predicting house prices.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Residual Analysis: Check the residuals to ensure the assumptions of
  linear regression are met.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Model Comparison: Compare the performance of our initial model and the
  enhanced Ridge Regression model.
  \end{quote}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{5.1 Feature Importance}

For linear models, the coefficients represent the change in the
dependent variable for a one-unit change in the predictor variable.
Let's examine the coefficients of our Ridge Regression model to
understand feature importance.

\begin{verbatim}
# Extract feature importance (coefficients) from the Ridge Regression model
feature_importance = best_ridge.coef_

# Create a DataFrame for feature importance
feature_importance_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Feature': X_train.columns,
    'Importance': feature_importance})

# Sort the features based on absolute importance
feature_importance_df = 
feature_importance_df.sort_values(by='Importance', key=abs, ascending=False)

\end{verbatim}
\includegraphics[width=4.925in,height=2.70833in]{image2.png}

The table above ranks features based on their importance in predicting
house prices:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Bathroom: The number of bathrooms appears to have the most significant
  positive influence on the price.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Area: The area of the house also has a notable positive impact on the
  price.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Per\_Sqft: The price per square foot positively influences the house
  price.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Transaction\_Resale: Houses that are up for resale tend to have a
  negative impact on the price when compared to new properties.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  BHK: The number of bedrooms (BHK) has a positive influence on the
  price.
  \end{quote}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{5.2 Residual Analysis}

Residuals are the differences between the observed and predicted values.
Analyzing residuals can help ensure the assumptions of linear regression
are met. We'll plot residuals to check for patterns. Ideally, residuals
should be randomly scattered around zero.

\begin{verbatim}
# Calculate residuals
residuals = y_test - y_pred_ridge

# Plot residuals
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.scatterplot(x=y_pred_ridge, y=residuals)
plt.axhline(y=0, color='red', linestyle='--')
plt.title('Residuals vs. Predicted Values')
plt.xlabel('Predicted Values')
plt.ylabel('Residuals')
plt.show()
\end{verbatim}

The residuals plot shows that:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Residuals are mostly scattered around the zero line, which is a good
  sign.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  There's no obvious pattern or curve in the residuals, suggesting that
  linearity assumptions are reasonably met.
  \end{quote}
\end{itemize}

However, there are some outliers, indicating that the model may not
capture some nuances of the data perfectly.

\textbf{5.3 Model Comparison}

To recap, we initially used a Linear Regression model and later an
optimized Ridge Regression model. Let's compare the performance metrics
of both:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Linear Regression:
  \end{quote}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  R²: 0.593
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  RMSE: 0.686
  \end{quote}
\end{itemize}

2. Ridge Regression (with feature engineering and hyperparameter
tuning):

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  R²: 0.590
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  RMSE: 0.688
  \end{quote}
\end{itemize}

The performance metrics are quite close, but the Ridge Regression model
might be more robust due to its regularization properties, especially
when adding new features.

\textcenter{Step 6: Knowledge Representation}

After mining data and evaluating patterns, it's crucial to represent the
acquired knowledge in an understandable and actionable format. This can
include visualizations, dashboards, or reports that summarize the main
findings.

For our dataset and models:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Feature Importance Visualization: A bar chart to visualize the
  importance of each feature in predicting house prices.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Model Summary: A comparison table of the two models' performance
  metrics.
  \end{quote}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{6.1 Feature Importance Visualization}

Let's visualize the importance of each feature in predicting house
prices based on our Ridge Regression model's coefficients.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Features like the number of bathrooms, area of the house, and price
  per square foot have a significant positive influence on the house
  price.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  The transaction type (resale vs. new property) and readiness status of
  the house also play a role in influencing the price, though to a
  lesser degree.
  \end{quote}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{6.2 Model Summary}

The model summary provides a concise comparison of the two models:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Both the Linear Regression and Ridge Regression models have similar
  performance metrics.
  \end{quote}
\item
  \begin{quote}
  Ridge Regression, with its regularization, might offer more robust
  predictions, especially when considering feature engineering or when
  the dataset grows.
  \end{quote}
\end{itemize}

\textcenter{Step 7: Deployment}

The final step in the KDD process is deploying the acquired knowledge or
predictive model into a production environment. Deployment can be in the
form of:

Given the context, if we were to deploy the Ridge Regression model, it
could be integrated into a property pricing platform to provide instant
price estimates based on the provided features. Additionally, insights
from the EDA and feature importance analysis could be presented in
dashboards or reports to guide real estate strategy.
