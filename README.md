## Assignment 1

**ChatGPT Prompt**: 

>ChatGPT, please act as an Expert in Data Science with proficiency in the CRISP-DM methodology. The uploaded file is an India Stock market. Understand data & decide machine learning problems and perform a step-by-step Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). prepare all the steps and reports of the methodology in a principled fashion on data understanding, data analysis, data visualization, data cleaning, data preprocessing, feature selection, data clustering, outlier analysis, and processing. Provide proper metrics for these techniques and final recommendations. Use the best possible methods to solve the issue and adhere to industry best practices. Begin with the initial steps of the CRISP-DM methodology, and provide insights at each phase. Use best practice and also explain why it is best. Your expertise is crucial for the success of this project. Use your most popular ML packages like Scikit etc. Please respond in small size chunks starting with the initial steps of CRISP-DM methodology to all the steps for this data set. It is important to chunk this above problem and respond in chunks. Continue your process when I reply with the word next. repeat the requirement in each chunk towards the end of the chunk and explain where you are(mindmap) in the process and what will you do next. Assume you have limited computing and hence you chunk the process effectively. Your main objective is to understand the Dataset & cleanup if required, Build a model to predict stock price, and also fine-tune the hyperparameters.
