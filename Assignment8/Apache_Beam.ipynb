        "\n",
        "We simulated logs from a website, containing user IDs, timestamps, and the type of action they performed (e.g., \"login\", \"view_item\", \"purchase\"). The main objectives were:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Count the number of each action type within a certain window.\n",
        "* Identify users who performed a \"login\" action followed by a \"purchase\" action within a 10-minute window.\n",
        "* Filter out any bots, assumed to be users with more than 100 actions within a 10-minute window.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Apache Beam Features Demonstrated:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Pipeline Creation: Established the foundation to build the data processing tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Reading Data with IO: Utilized the beam.Create() method to ingest mock log data into the pipeline.\n",
        "\n",
        "* ParDo and DoFn: Demonstrated parallel processing by creating custom functions (DoFn) like FilterBots and FindLoginThenPurchase.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Windowing: Partitioned data into fixed 10-minute windows using beam.WindowInto(window.FixedWindows(600)).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Triggers: Introduced triggers to control when data in a window becomes available for downstream operations. Used a combination of AfterCount and AfterWatermark to specify conditions when the window data should be processed.\n",
        "\n",
        "* GroupByKey: Grouped data by user ID, allowing us to process all actions performed by each user within a window.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Composite Transforms: Created a composite transform CountWords to demonstrate how multiple transforms can be grouped into one logical operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Filtering and Mapping: Utilized beam.Map() and custom filtering functions to transform and filter data based on specific criteria.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Outcomes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Action Counts: The pipeline outputted counts for each action type within the specified window.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. User Identification: Identified and printed users who performed a \"login\" action followed by a \"purchase\" within the windowed timeframe.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Bot Filtering: Successfully filtered out users (bots) performing an unusually high number of actions within the window."
