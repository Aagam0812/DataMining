Based on the requirements and assumptions, we will need the following core classes, functions, and methods:

1. `app.py`: This is the entry point of our application. It will contain the Flask app instance and the routes for our website.

2. `get_trivia_question(topic)`: This function will be in `app.py`. It will take a topic as input, send a request to the trivia API, and return the question and answer.

3. `templates/index.html`: This is the HTML template for our website. It will contain the form for user input and the display for the trivia question and answer.

4. `static/styles.css`: This is the CSS file for styling our website.

5. `requirements.txt`: This file will list all the Python packages that need to be installed for our application to run.

Now, let's write the code for each file.

app.py
