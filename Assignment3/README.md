# AutoML House Price Prediction with DataRobot 🏡🤖

Welcome to the AutoML House Price Prediction project! We utilize the power of DataRobot to create a predictive model for house prices based on various factors. 

## Dataset Overview 📊

The dataset offers detailed insights into house characteristics which can be influential in determining its price:

- **Price** 💰: The price of the house.
- **Area** 📏: Total area of the house (in sq. ft.).
