# Dimensionality Reduction Techniques in Machine Learning 📊🔍

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various dimensionality reduction techniques applied to different datasets. The focus is on both the effectiveness of these techniques and their limitations.

## Contents 📁

1. **Dimensionality Reduction Techniques Overview** 🌟:
   - Covers a range of techniques including PCA, SVD, MDS, ISOMap, LLE, UMAP, and t-SNE. This notebook includes visualizations, hyperparameter selection strategies, and uses the UMAP visualizer for enhanced understanding.
  
2. **UMAP for Clustering and Classification** 📈:
   - Illustrates how UMAP can be used for clustering and as a feature extraction technique for classification. This notebook follows examples and guidelines from the UMAP documentation.
   

3. **Dimensionality Reduction using Databricks** 🔥:
   - A notebook demonstrating how to perform dimensionality reduction using Databricks.
